# Solar-Home-Lighting-system
Solar energy is an energy generated by the sun. It can be harnessed directly or indirectly for human use. This project gives an insight to solar powered home lighting system that uses solarpower and LED lighting technology in a more efficient way. Solar power systems use solarpanels to convert the sunâ€™s energy directly to electricity. This electricity is stored in the batteries that can supply only DC output. All available lighting systems, including LED lights, work on AC power.Sothe DC supply needs to be converted to AC using inverters .The system uses the batteries to store the electricity. The system also monitors State of batteries . If the Solar voltage is not sufficient for charging or during the night time, the battery gets charged through the battery charger driven by AC mains.

# Objectives 

1. Interfacing the solar panel and the  A.C. source to the control switches.
2. To implement an algorithm that converts the analog levels into its digital form and controls the overall working using PIC16f877A microcontroller.
3. To display the state of the batteries using an LCD display.
4. To interface two batteries to store the electrical energy and interface LEDs as load to display the working of the circuit.

# Objectives Description

1. Interfacing the solar panel and the  A.C. source to the control switches

A 80W,12V solar panel is interfaced at port CON1 and AC source is interfaced to the port CON2 as shown figure 2. The voltage level is varied according to the required specifications which is passed to the circuit.
For the purpose of demonstration, a D.C regulated power supply is used as a substitute for the solar panel and A.C source. 


2. To implement an algorithm that converts the analog levels into its digital form and controls the overall working using PIC16f877A microcontroller

The PIC16f877A microcontroller is responsible for the entire functioning and programming of the circuit. A code is written to read the analog inputs, ADC, comparing the voltage levels, triggering the relays and displaying the output on the LCD.
The code is then burnt onto the PIC16f877A controller. 


3. To display the state of the batteries using an LCD display.

The LCD is 16x2 LCD display that uses light modulating properties of liquid crystals with combined polarizers.
The microcontroller takes in the value of the batteries and then displays the state of the batteries on the LCD display by sending the proper commands via the microcontroller code.


4. To interface two batteries to store the electrical energy and to  interface LEDs as load to display the working of the circuit.

Two 12V, 80Ah batteries are used to store the energy and use it as a source for the home lighting system. The batteries are charged by the solar panel or the A.C. source based on the algorithm.
The LEDs are used as a load which consists of semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. The LEDs are the main actuators of the project that uses the energy stored in the battery representing a home lighting system.
